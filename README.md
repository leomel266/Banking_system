# Banking_system
 Banking system, using OOP and SQlite3
 
 
 The bank system creates a database, where the data of the accounts, deposits, balance and others are stored.
Yes, you do not have an account created, you can create one and the system will give you a unique number to access that account, using random numbers. This interface does not have a GUI, therefore it can only be managed by console.
